Key Features:

Express Setup: The app uses Express to handle HTTP requests and listens on port 3000.

Middleware: Uses express.json() middleware to parse incoming JSON payloads in request bodies.

In-memory Data Store: An array called users simulates a simple user database with user objects containing id and name.

API Endpoints:

GET /api/users
Returns the full list of users in JSON format.

GET /api/users/:id
Returns a single user identified by the id URL parameter. If the user is not found, it responds with a 404 status and an error message.

POST /api/users
Creates a new user with a name supplied in the request body. The new user is assigned a unique id based on the current number of users. The server responds with the newly created user and a 201 status code.

PUT /api/users/:id
Updates the name of an existing user specified by id. If the user doesnâ€™t exist, responds with a 404 error. Otherwise, updates the user's name and returns the updated user.

DELETE /api/users/:id
Deletes the user with the specified id. Responds with status 204 (No Content) on success.

Summary:

This code sets up a straightforward user management API suitable for learning or prototyping purposes. It demonstrates how to handle routing, request parsing, and basic in-memory data manipulation with Express.js.
